            You turn out of the park and continue walking home…
        </p>
        <p>
            The door shuts with a familiar click behind you. Toeing out of your shoes, you toss your bag thoughtlessly 
            onto your couch and lay down next to it. You replay the conversations you just had, letting the words swirl 
            in your mind a little longer. The noise in your head gradually fades as the sound of birds chirping seeps 
            through the window.

        </p>

            You’ll get up, do your laundry, and write your term paper. You’ll go to sleep and wake up the next morning. 
            Maybe you’ll give yourself just five more minutes—maybe the sun will wait for you until you’re ready. 
            You’ll brush your teeth, get dressed, and . You will walk out the door again, occupied by the immediate 
            demands of today, <a href="index.html">the memory of yesterday already a distant hum.</a>
