            You turn out of the park and continue walking home…
        </p>
        <p>
            The door shuts with a familiar click behind you. Toeing out of your shoes, you lay down on the couch. 
            Maybe you say hi to one of your roommates on the way. You recount the conversations you just had, sitting 
            in the puddle of toxicity for a little longer. The recollections of blathers melt in your head as the sound 
            of a bird’s chirps seeps through your window.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’ll get up, and you’ll do your laundry, and you’ll write your term paper. You’ll go to sleep and wake up the 
            next morning. You’ll brush your teeth, get dressed, and walk out the door again, occupied by the immediate demands 
            of today, <a href="index.html">the memory of yesterday already a distant hum.</a>
