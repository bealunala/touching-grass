        A: We got into an argument again last night.<br>
        A: He’s seriously pissing me off.<br><br>
        
        B: What?? I thought y’all’s relationship was finally going well after that one fight.<br><br>
        
        A: Yeah, but he went out with his friends a few days ago, and a girl hit on him and asked for his number.<br>
        A: Guess what this motherfucker did.<br><br>
        
        B: Oh no...<br><br>
        
        A: He said “Sorry, I have a girlfriend”<br><br>
        
        B’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion.<br><br>
        B: Wait–what’s bad about that? He said no.<br><br>
        
        A gestured into the air incredulously.<br><br>
        
        A: What do you mean? He said “sorry.” That’s like saying “Oh, I would, but I can’t.”<br><br>
        
        B: Girl…<br>
        B laughs a bit quizzically. She looks as if she were about to say something, but A cuts her off before she can say anything.<br><br>
        
        A: Saying 'sorry, I have a girlfriend' and 'no, I have a girlfriend' are never the same.<br><br>

            <p>
                A: No, but it really is. The hell does he have to be sorry for?<br><br>
        
                B: Uhh, hurting that girl’s feelings? Rejection sucks.<br><br>
        
                A: Fuck her feelings. Why would her feelings be hurt over him having a girlfriend? He doesn't even know her. Be for real.<br><br>
        
                B: Well I’m sorry for not wanting my partner to be some heartless asshole.<br>
                B: You don’t think you’re, maybe, projecting a bit?<br><br>
        
                A: I just don’t trust him<br><br>
        
                B: If your relationship is so fragile that one word is making you throw a fit, just break up with him.<br>
                B: No man is worth all that girl.
