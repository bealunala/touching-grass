        A: We got into an argument again last night.<br>
        A: He’s seriously pissing me off.<br><br>
        
        B: What?? I thought y’all’s relationship was finally going well after that one fight.<br><br>
        
        A: Yeah, but he went out with his friends a few days ago, and a girl hit on him and asked for his number.<br>
        A: Guess what this motherfucker did.<br><br>
        
        B: Oh no...<br><br>
        
        A: He said “Sorry, I have a girlfriend”<br><br>
        
        B’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion.<br><br>
        B: Wait–what’s bad about that? He said no.<br><br>
        
        A gestured into the air incredulously.<br><br>
        
        A: What do you mean? He said “sorry.” That’s like saying “Oh, I would, but I can’t.”<br><br>
        
        B: Girl…<br>
        B laughs a bit quizzically. She looks as if she were about to say something, but A cuts her off before she can say anything.<br><br>
        
        A: Saying 'sorry, I have a girlfriend' and 'no, I have a girlfriend' are never the same.<br><br>
