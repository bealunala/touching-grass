            Growing up with easy and loosely-restricted access to the Internet has led me down various rabbit holes 
            of creativity, community, and toxicity. The internet grants people the gall to say things they wouldn’t 
            dare to say to someone’s face, let alone in real life. [more context and blah blah]

            Touching Grass aims to highlight the absurdity of some online interactions, how quickly they devolve 
            into baseless ad hominems, and the minimal impact they truly make on someone’s life outside of their 
            screen. It takes form as a point-and-click narrative, where a user plays a nameless, impartial individual 
            walking home from the park, getting roped up in passersby’s conversations during the process. 
            The conversations are ludicrous and satirical, heavily based on interactions I’ve witnessed 
            during my time scrolling through countless posts and comments online.
