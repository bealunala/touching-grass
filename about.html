        <p style="color: whitesmoke;">
            Growing up with easy and loosely-restricted access to the Internet has led me down various rabbit holes 
            of different types of communities. The internet grants people the gall to say things they wouldn’t 
            dare to say to someone’s face, let alone in real life. This often leads to excessive bigotry, which can (and has)
            made the Internet feel unsafe for marginalized groups online. This is particularly concerning since online 
            platforms often serve as a safe space, a reprieve of sorts, for people's real and difficult lives.

          My intervention, named “touching grass,” aims to highlight the absurdity of some online interactions, 
          how quickly they devolve into baseless ad hominems, and the minimal impact they truly make on someone’s 
          life outside of their screen. It takes form as a point-and-click narrative, where a user plays a nameless, 
          impartial individual walking home from the park, getting roped up in passersby’s conversations during the 
          process. The conversations are ludicrous and satirical, heavily based on real interactions I’ve witnessed 
          during my time scrolling through countless posts and comments.

          Please note that Touching Grass is still a work in progress. Due to time constraints, this website is merely a 
          template of the final product in mind :'D
