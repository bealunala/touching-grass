            <p>C1: What shows have you watched recently?</p>

            <p>C2: Have you heard of Saiki K?<br>
            I just started watching it on Netflix; it’s pretty good! You should watch it.</p>
            
            <p>C1: I’ve heard good things about it, but I'm weirdly scared to start it.<br>
                I’m worried I’ll like it too much.
            </p>
            
            <p>C2: What do you mean?</p>
            <p>C1: I have this tendency to get super fixated on my interests, and they end up consuming almost all of my free time.<br>
                So if I get into something new, all that time I spent enjoying my old interests would be a waste almost.<br>
                Like, what if I end up liking a new show so much that I lose interest in all the things I've already invested so much time into?<br>
                That could just be a me thing though, I don’t know...
